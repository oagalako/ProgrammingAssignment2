## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do: 
## These two functions compute the inverse of a square 
## invertible matrix while storing it in cache, and while using function solve()
## to calculate the inverse.
## The first function creates a special matrix object that can cache its inverse.
## The second function, after checking the cache, either returns the
## inverse from the cache, or, if the original matrix has changed (and cache became NULL)
## calculates and returns the inverse of the new matrix.

## Write a short comment describing this function
## makeCacheMatrix function creates a special matrix object that can cache its inverse. 
## It creates a list of functions (set, get, setsolve, getsolve)used by function cacheSolve 
## to get or set the inverted matrix in cache.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        m <- NULL
        set <- function(y){
                x <<- y
                m <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setsolve <- function(solve) m <<- solve
        getsolve <- function() m
        list(set = set, get = get,
        setsolve = setsolve,
        getsolve = getsolve)
}


## Write a short comment describing this function
## cacheSolve function retrieves the inverse from cache, 
## if it is there, and if not, calculates the inverse.
